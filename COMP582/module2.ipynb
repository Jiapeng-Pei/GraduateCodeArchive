    "  - For pop operations, the complexity is $O(1)$.\n",
    "  - For push operations when the stack is not full, the complexity is $O(1)$.\n",
    "  - For push operations when the stack is full, where N is the size of the stack. We have: \n",
    "  \n",
    "    $T_{copy}(N) = 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + N $\n",
    "    $= 1 + 3(1 + 3 + ... + N/3)$\n",
    "    $= 1 + 3T_{copy}(N/3)$\n",
    "    $= 1 + 3 + 9T_{copy}(N/9)$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Further reduce the above equation, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $T_{copy}(N) = 1 + 3 + ... + 3^kT_{copy}(1)$, where $3^k = N$, $T_{copy}(1) = 1$. So:\n",

    "  #### Prove 1\n",
    "  From the graph we can find that tree No.2 is the \"father\" of 3 subtrees, including tree No.1 of size 1, tree No.4 of size 3 and tree No.7 of size 5. \n",
    "  - Suppose there exists a valid sequence of operations that produce the current tree. \n",
    "  - We must union tree No.1 with tree No.2 at first, since only its size is not bigger than tree No.2. This makes the size of tree No.2 equal to 2.\n",
    "  - Either size of tree No.4 or that of tree No.5 is bigger than 2. So in next union operation, tree No.2 won't be a union target. This controdicts the current tree. \n",
    "  - So the assumption is false. There is no possible sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "  #### Prove 2\n",
    "  In a set with N nodes constructed by running weighted quick union, the height of the root is at most $\\log_2(N)$. \n",
    "  - Every time we merge 2 sets, The size of the merge target becomes at most twice as large as before, and in this case its height increases by 1. Suppose the height of this set is $h$, and there are at most $h^2$ (or $N$) elements in the set. So the height is at most $\\log_2(N)$.\n",
    "  - But in Q3's case, the height of the set is $5$, which is bigger than $\\log_2(10)$. So it is impossible. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. $O(N + M\\log^*(N))$. \n",
    "  Suppose there are $N$ add_new_set operations and $M$ union/find operations. A single add_new_set operations takes $O(1)$, and all add_new_set operations take $O(N)$. In worst cases the size of our set is $N$ when performing $M$ union/find operations. For a weighted quick union-set with path compression, it takes $O(Mlog^*(N))$.\n",

    "  So the complexity will be $O(N + M\\log^*(N))$. \n",
